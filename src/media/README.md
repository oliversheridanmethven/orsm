# Media

A collection of tools for working with media, such as images and
videos. 

## ASCII

### Images

We have a tool which can convert images to ASCII in `images.py`.

### Video

We have a small command line tool which displays the webcam feed
as an ASCII image.

## Sixel

!!! note "Try Sixel"
    Sixel is a nice way to show graphics in the terminal window. It would
    be very interesting to see if I can get my application to support this.
